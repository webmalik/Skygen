					<p>Safety glass – toughened and laminated</p>
					<span>
						The type of glazing used can significantly increase the safety of
						the household members. Laminated and toughened glass are more
						resistant to puncture or breakage. Therefore, they effectively
						reduce the risk of burglary or theft. Moreover, they are “safe”
						panes also in another aspect. In the event of breaking the laminated
						pane, the glass shatters remain attached to the special foil that
						covers the pane. This reduces the risk of injury to those around
						you. In turn, the toughened glass breaks into small particles with
						blunt edges, which minimizes the risk of injury.
					</span>
					<p>Handles – anti-burglary with a lock and a key</p>
					<span>
						A small element that can have a big impact on safety is the handle.
						There are handles available on the market that block the access of
						uninvited guests from the outside, but also protect against opening
						windows or balcony doors from the inside. The Hoppe Secustic
						anti-burglary handle with a key has a self-securing mechanism that
						blocks its rotation. If you try to get into an apartment or house
						and push the fitting with a tool, the window movement is blocked.
						The ability to turn the key from the inside and close the window,
						balcony or terrace doors allows to ensure the safety of the youngest
						family members.
					</span>
					<p>Window profiles and fittings</p>
					<span>
						Safe windows are equipped with appropriate profiles. To be able to
						give them anti-burglary status, they must have a closed steel
						reinforcement throughout their perimeter and be permanently screwed
						to the profiles with screws. If windows and balcony doors are to
						constitute a solid barrier for burglars, it is worth supplementing
						the fittings with additional elements. Examples include
						anti-burglary catches, anti-burglary pivots with adjustable pressure
						or a lock for incorrect handle position. The construction of
						profiles, fittings, glass, and handles are the basic elements that
						affect the safety of the window joinery. If we want even better
						protection of real estate, property, and household members, let’s
						opt for an alarm system and special anti-burglary roller blinds.

					<p>Safety glass – toughened and laminated</p>
					<span>
						The type of glazing used can significantly increase the safety of
						the household members. Laminated and toughened glass are more
						resistant to puncture or breakage. Therefore, they effectively
						reduce the risk of burglary or theft. Moreover, they are “safe”
						panes also in another aspect. In the event of breaking the laminated
						pane, the glass shatters remain attached to the special foil that
						covers the pane. This reduces the risk of injury to those around
						you. In turn, the toughened glass breaks into small particles with
						blunt edges, which minimizes the risk of injury.
					</span>
					<p>Handles – anti-burglary with a lock and a key</p>
					<span>
						A small element that can have a big impact on safety is the handle.
						There are handles available on the market that block the access of
						uninvited guests from the outside, but also protect against opening
						windows or balcony doors from the inside. The Hoppe Secustic
						anti-burglary handle with a key has a self-securing mechanism that
						blocks its rotation. If you try to get into an apartment or house
						and push the fitting with a tool, the window movement is blocked.
						The ability to turn the key from the inside and close the window,
						balcony or terrace doors allows to ensure the safety of the youngest
						family members.
					</span>
					<p>Window profiles and fittings</p>
					<span>
						Safe windows are equipped with appropriate profiles. To be able to
						give them anti-burglary status, they must have a closed steel
						reinforcement throughout their perimeter and be permanently screwed
						to the profiles with screws. If windows and balcony doors are to
						constitute a solid barrier for burglars, it is worth supplementing
						the fittings with additional elements. Examples include
						anti-burglary catches, anti-burglary pivots with adjustable pressure
						or a lock for incorrect handle position. The construction of
						profiles, fittings, glass, and handles are the basic elements that
						affect the safety of the window joinery. If we want even better
						protection of real estate, property, and household members, let’s
						opt for an alarm system and special anti-burglary roller blinds.

					Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) produce as much energy as they consume annually, combining energy
					efficiency and
					renewables. NZEBs cut costs, enhance comfort, reduce environmental impact, and ensure energy security.
					They consist of
					two components: energy production (utilizing renewables) and energy efficiency (design, materials, and
					equipment).
					Windows play a crucial role in NZEBs, aiding ventilation, passive heating/cooling, and insulation. They
					reduce the need
					for mechanical systems, optimize temperature, and minimize heat transfer.
				</div>
				<div class="window__item">
					Department of Energy guidelines provide insights into NZEB principles for various building types,
					promoting
					energy-efficient design and renewables. Vistaza supports sustainability, offering expertise on
					integrating
					high-performance windows into NZEBs. Despite budget concerns, investing in these windows enhances energy
					efficiency,
					natural lighting, and overall project sustainability. Contact Vistaza for guidance on creating
					aesthetically appealing

						<p>Colored uPVC windows offer a versatile alternative to traditional wood, combining aesthetics with
							low maintenance and
							energy efficiency. Foil-wrapped uPVC windows, using a heat bonding process, closely mimic the
							texture and color of wood,
							providing a durable and authentic appearance. Advantages include authentic wood grain, durability
							(30+ years lifespan),
							low maintenance, and excellent energy efficiency.</p>
						<p>
							Foil-wrapped uPVC windows also provide design versatility, allowing customization to match
							individual preferences. While
							repairing uPVC foil is possible, painting uPVC windows is generally not recommended due to
							potential drawbacks like
							reduced lifespan, maintenance issues, and warranty concerns.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="window__item">
					In conclusion, foil-wrapped uPVC windows offer a superior solution for coloring uPVC frames, providing
					durability, low
					maintenance, and energy efficiency. While there may be instances where paint is preferred, choosing
					foil-wrapped uPVC
					windows is generally recommended for a long-lasting and aesthetically pleasing result.

							<p>PHI vs. PHIUS</p>
							<span>
								PHI and PHIUS, though sharing the goal of promoting energy-efficient construction, diverge in
								their approaches and
								standards due to varied climate conditions. PHI's European Standard caters to the international
								market, while PHIUS
								tailors its American Standard to North American climate needs.
