						Safety glass – toughened and laminated
					</p>
					<span>
						The type of glazing used can significantly increase the safety of the household members. Laminated
						and toughened glass
						are more resistant to puncture or breakage. Therefore, they effectively reduce the risk of burglary
						or theft.
						Moreover, they are “safe” panes also in another aspect. In the event of breaking the laminated
						pane, the glass shatters
						remain attached to the special foil that covers the pane. This reduces the risk of injury to those
						around you. In turn,
						the toughened glass breaks into small particles with blunt edges, which minimizes the risk of
						injury.
					</span>
					<p>
						Handles – anti-burglary with a lock and a key
					</p>
					<span>
						A small element that can have a big impact on safety is the handle. There are handles available on
						the market that block
						the access of uninvited guests from the outside, but also protect against opening windows or
						balcony doors from the
						inside.
						The Hoppe Secustic anti-burglary handle with a key has a self-securing mechanism that blocks its
						rotation. If you try to
						get into an apartment or house and push the fitting with a tool, the window movement is blocked.
						The ability to turn the
						key from the inside and close the window, balcony or terrace doors allows to ensure the safety of
						the youngest family
						members.
					</span>
					<p>
						Window profiles and fittings
					</p>
					<span>
						Safe windows are equipped with appropriate profiles. To be able to give them anti-burglary status,
						they must have a
						closed steel reinforcement throughout their perimeter and be permanently screwed to the profiles
						with screws. If windows
						and balcony doors are to constitute a solid barrier for burglars, it is worth supplementing the
						fittings with additional
						elements. Examples include anti-burglary catches, anti-burglary pivots with adjustable pressure or
						a lock for incorrect
						handle position.
						The construction of profiles, fittings, glass, and handles are the basic elements that affect the
						safety of the window
						joinery. If we want even better protection of real estate, property, and household members, let’s
						opt for an alarm
						system and special anti-burglary roller blinds.

						Windows play a pivotal role in urban multifamily housing projects,
						offering ventilation, natural light, and aesthetic appeal. For
						architects engaged in such projects, selecting the right windows
						involves considering key factors. This guide delves into crucial
						considerations when choosing windows for multifamily housing,
						offering architects a comprehensive understanding of the
						decision-making process.

							<p>Durability, Low Maintenance & Safety</p>
						</div>
						Durability and safety are paramount in window selection. Opt for
						materials like fiberglass, vinyl, or uPVC that require minimal
						maintenance. Robust locking mechanisms enhance security, providing
						assurance to residents, especially parents concerned about their
						children's safety.
					</div>
					<div class="window__block-wrapper">
						<div class="window__num">
							<span class="number">2</span>
							<p>Energy Efficiency in Multifamily Housing Windows</p>
						</div>
						Energy efficiency is paramount in reducing heat transfer and cutting
						energy costs. Look for windows with low U-values and Solar Heat Gain
						Coefficients (SHGC). Materials like uPVC, aluminum, vinyl, and
						fiberglass are renowned for their energy-efficient properties.
						Understanding technical terms such as U-factor, SHGC, low-E glass,
						and argon gas is crucial for informed decision-making. Different
						states have varying window energy requirements; for instance, New
						York, California, Pennsylvania, Alaska, Washington, and
						Massachusetts have specific standards tailored to their climate
						zones.

							<p>Soundproofing</p>
						</div>
						In densely populated areas, soundproof windows are essential for
						residents' well-being. Architectural acoustics, involving
						absorption, reflection, and diffusion, play a vital role in
						achieving optimal soundproofing. Following building codes for sound
						insulation in multifamily residential buildings is crucial for
						maintaining privacy. OITC and STC ratings are key considerations,
						measuring sound transmission and overall soundproofing
						effectiveness. Recognizing the impact of external noise sources,
						like traffic, trains, and planes, is essential when selecting
						soundproof windows.

				<div class="window__item">
					<div class="window__block-wrapper">
						<div class="window__num">
							<span class="number">4</span>
							<p>Compliance with Local Council Guidelines</p>
						</div>
						When choosing windows for multifamily housing, adherence to local
						council guidelines is non-negotiable. Specific regulations, like New
						York City's mandate for bird-safe glasses in buildings over 40 feet,
						must be considered. Bird-friendly glass is gaining traction
						nationally, exemplified by the Bird-Safe Buildings Act. Cities such
						as San Francisco and Washington, D.C., are also implementing or
						considering bird-friendly building legislation. Balancing daylight,
						views, and ventilation is vital, and high-performance windows or
						alternative solutions like solar tube lighting can contribute to
						energy efficiency.
					</div>
					<div class="window__block-wrapper">
						<div class="window__num">
							<span class="number">5</span>
							<p>Aesthetics</p>
						</div>
						While functionality is crucial, the aesthetic contribution of
						windows should not be overlooked. Windows impact the visual appeal
						of the building and can enhance architectural design. Consider
						style, color, and frame material options that align with the
						project's overall aesthetic vision.

						Choosing between uPVC and vinyl windows for your replacement project
						may seem like a simple decision, but their subtle distinctions can

						to help you make an informed decision for your home.
					</div>
					<div class="window__block">
						While both uPVC and vinyl windows share PVC as a base material,
						their manufacturing processes create distinct characteristics. uPVC,
						with its rigid and durable nature, undergoes a process of
						eliminating plasticizers, ensuring resilience against impact,
						weathering, and fading. On the other hand, vinyl windows, crafted
						with retained plasticizers, offer flexibility and molding
						versatility.
					</div>
					<div class="window__block">
						uPVC is the go-to for superior insulation, making it ideal for
						frames, sills, and door frames. Vinyl windows, while affordable and
						energy-efficient, are less commonly used due to lower strength and
						potential for warping.
