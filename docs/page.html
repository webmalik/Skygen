						Safety glass – toughened and laminated
					</p>
					<span>
						The type of glazing used can significantly increase the safety of the household members. Laminated
						and toughened glass
						are more resistant to puncture or breakage. Therefore, they effectively reduce the risk of burglary
						or theft.
						Moreover, they are “safe” panes also in another aspect. In the event of breaking the laminated
						pane, the glass shatters
						remain attached to the special foil that covers the pane. This reduces the risk of injury to those
						around you. In turn,
						the toughened glass breaks into small particles with blunt edges, which minimizes the risk of
						injury.
					</span>
					<p>
						Handles – anti-burglary with a lock and a key
					</p>
					<span>
						A small element that can have a big impact on safety is the handle. There are handles available on
						the market that block
						the access of uninvited guests from the outside, but also protect against opening windows or
						balcony doors from the
						inside.
						The Hoppe Secustic anti-burglary handle with a key has a self-securing mechanism that blocks its
						rotation. If you try to
						get into an apartment or house and push the fitting with a tool, the window movement is blocked.
						The ability to turn the
						key from the inside and close the window, balcony or terrace doors allows to ensure the safety of
						the youngest family
						members.
					</span>
					<p>
						Window profiles and fittings
					</p>
					<span>
						Safe windows are equipped with appropriate profiles. To be able to give them anti-burglary status,
						they must have a
						closed steel reinforcement throughout their perimeter and be permanently screwed to the profiles
						with screws. If windows
						and balcony doors are to constitute a solid barrier for burglars, it is worth supplementing the
						fittings with additional
						elements. Examples include anti-burglary catches, anti-burglary pivots with adjustable pressure or
						a lock for incorrect
						handle position.
						The construction of profiles, fittings, glass, and handles are the basic elements that affect the
						safety of the window
						joinery. If we want even better protection of real estate, property, and household members, let’s
						opt for an alarm
						system and special anti-burglary roller blinds.

						Safety glass – toughened and laminated
					</p>
					<span>
						The type of glazing used can significantly increase the safety of the household members. Laminated

						or theft.
						Moreover, they are “safe” panes also in another aspect. In the event of breaking the laminated
						pane, the glass shatters
