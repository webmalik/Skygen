										MB-79N Casement is part of the MB-79N system used for
										constructions such as: fixed, casement, tilt, tilt and turn
										and tilt and slide windows, single and double-leaf external
										doors, as well as shopfront solutions with doors. Its main
										features are good thermal and acoustic insulation as well as
										water and air tightness. The windows are adapted to the
										stricter thermal insulation requirements of the European
										Directive 2010/31/EU in force from 2021, allowing their use
										in passive buildings.
										<br /><br />
										Depending on particular needs, there are two variants of
										aluminium sections to choose from with different technical
										parameters: the ST variant (with a two-component central
										seal) and the SI variant (with an additional insulation
										insert inside the chamber between the thermal breaks).
										Thanks to the wide range of sections and their rigidity,
										this system allows for making large and heavy structures. It
										is also characterised by excellent kinematics, which allows
										for the construction of very narrow windows. MB-79N Casement

										MULLION AND TRANSOM CURTAIN WALL WITH HIGH THERMAL PERFORMANCE
									</div>
									<p>
										The structure presented here is a version of MB-SR50N featuring enhanced thermal
										insulation performance. <br><br>
										The system is designed for the construction and execution of flat, light-weight curtain
										walls of the suspended or
										filling type, roofs, skylights and other structures. The shapes of profiles enable
										selection of mullion and transom
										profiles which flush with each other on the inside surface of the façade.

								</div>
								<div class="products__text">
									<p>
										The MB-SR50N HI system features basic characteristics and possibilities inherent in the
										base construction MB-SR50N. The
										thermal insulation zone deserves a particular mention, though. Here, special two-component
										insulators have been applied.
										They are based on a HPVC insulator (or a set of insulators of appropriate width), which
										makes it possible to drive
										screws with high accuracy during the installation process at the building site. On both
										lateral surfaces of the
										insulator additional elements made of flexible material are attached (glued on), which
										enhance thermal insulation
										performance and limit the air flow in the space separating the infills of the façade. The
										insulator built in this way
										enables maintaining convenience and accuracy of mounting of a traditional façade, ensuring
										at the same time that very
										good thermal insulation parameters are attained – the heat transfer coefficient, depending
										on the applied profiles and
										accessories spans between 0,94 to ,.94 W/m2K. Likewise in the base version of the façade,
										the structure allows for
										installation of different types of infills, including glazing of large dimensions and
										two-chamber insulating glazing
										units. With regard to active elements, the MB-70HI doors and windows featuring enhanced
										thermal insulation performance
										are particularly recommended for façades of the HI series.

									<p>
										Facade system designed for construction of lightweight cladding systems – flat curtain
										walls, infill walls and other
										spatial structures. The 60 mm wide mullions and transoms enable construction of aesthetic
										facades with exposed narrow
										division lines while ensuring durability and strength of the structure. The system enables
										flush installation of the
										mullions and transoms on the outside surface and offers a choice of external appearances.
										The advantages of MB-SR60N
										system include very good technical parameters, freedom of spatial arrangement and a wide
										variety of openable elements
										mounted in the facade. Particularly noteworthy is the MB-SR60N HI+ version of the system,
										which includes special thermal
										breaks and features improved thermal insulation performance. There is also a version
										without face caps visible from the
										outside - MB-SR60N EFEKT. Owing to an extensive range of profiles and accessories to
										choose from, the architects and
										designers can implement even the most daring aluminium-glass facade designs. For
										horizontally and vertically faceted
										walls special overlay profiles are used, accompanied with specially shaped pressure bars
										and face caps, which eliminate
										the restrictions in spatial arrangement of the building and the need to use special
										angular mullions. Modern accessories
										and connectors enable increasing the allowable load and thus the facade infill module can
										weigh up to 1,100 kg.

										Facade system designed for construction of lightweight cladding systems – flat curtain
										walls, infill walls and other
										spatial structures. The 60 mm wide mullions and transoms enable construction of aesthetic
										facades with exposed narrow
										division lines while ensuring durability and strength of the structure. The system enables
										flush installation of the
										mullions and transoms on the outside surface and offers a choice of external appearances.
										The advantages of MB-SR60N
										system include very good technical parameters, freedom of spatial arrangement and a wide
										variety of openable elements
										mounted in the facade. Particularly noteworthy is the MB-SR60N HI+ version of the system,
										which includes special thermal
										breaks and features improved thermal insulation performance. There is also a version
										without face caps visible from the
										outside - MB-SR60N EFEKT. Owing to an extensive range of profiles and accessories to
										choose from, the architects and
										designers can implement even the most daring aluminium-glass facade designs. For
										horizontally and vertically faceted
										walls special overlay profiles are used, accompanied with specially shaped pressure bars
										and face caps, which eliminate
										the restrictions in spatial arrangement of the building and the need to use special
										angular mullions. Modern accessories
										and connectors enable increasing the allowable load and thus the facade infill module can
										weigh up to 1,100 kg.
