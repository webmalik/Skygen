                    A modern and economical window system with improved thermal

                    MB-79N Casement is part of the MB-79N system used for
                    constructions such as: fixed, casement, tilt, tilt and turn
                    and tilt and slide windows, single and double-leaf external
                    doors, as well as shopfront solutions with doors. Its main
                    features are good thermal and acoustic insulation as well as
                    water and air tightness. The windows are adapted to the
                    stricter thermal insulation requirements of the European
                    Directive 2010/31/EU in force from 2021, allowing their use
                    in passive buildings.
                    <br /><br />
                    Depending on particular needs, there are two variants of
                    aluminium sections to choose from with different technical
                    parameters: the ST variant (with a two-component central
                    seal) and the SI variant (with an additional insulation
                    insert inside the chamber between the thermal breaks).
                    Thanks to the wide range of sections and their rigidity,
                    this system allows for making large and heavy structures. It
                    is also characterised by excellent kinematics, which allows
                    for the construction of very narrow windows. MB-79N Casement

                    It is characterised by delicate, slender profiles that use
                    the highest quality aluminium. Attention is drawn to the
                    perfectly balanced glass-to-frame ratio, which allows more

                    The MB-SR50N HI system features basic characteristics and
                    possibilities inherent in the base construction MB-SR50N.
                    The thermal insulation zone deserves a particular mention,
                    though. Here, special two-component insulators have been
                    applied. They are based on a HPVC insulator (or a set of
                    insulators of appropriate width), which makes it possible to
                    drive screws with high accuracy during the installation
                    process at the building site. On both lateral surfaces of
                    the insulator additional elements made of flexible material
                    are attached (glued on), which enhance thermal insulation
                    performance and limit the air flow in the space separating
                    the infills of the faÃ§ade. The insulator built in this way
                    enables maintaining convenience and accuracy of mounting of
                    a traditional faÃ§ade, ensuring at the same time that very
                    good thermal insulation parameters are attained â the heat
                    transfer coefficient, depending on the applied profiles and
                    accessories spans between 0,94 to ,.94 W/m2K. Likewise in
                    the base version of the faÃ§ade, the structure allows for
                    installation of different types of infills, including
                    glazing of large dimensions and two-chamber insulating
                    glazing units. With regard to active elements, the MB-70HI
                    doors and windows featuring enhanced thermal insulation

                    Facade system designed for construction of lightweight

                  <p>
                    Facade system designed for construction of lightweight
                    cladding systems â flat curtain walls, infill walls and
                    other spatial structures. The 60 mm wide mullions and
                    transoms enable construction of aesthetic facades with
                    exposed narrow division lines while ensuring durability and
                    strength of the structure. The system enables flush
                    installation of the mullions and transoms on the outside
                    surface and offers a choice of external appearances. The
                    advantages of MB-SR60N system include very good technical
                    parameters, freedom of spatial arrangement and a wide
                    variety of openable elements mounted in the facade.
                    Particularly noteworthy is the MB-SR60N HI+ version of the
                    system, which includes special thermal breaks and features
                    improved thermal insulation performance. There is also a
                    version without face caps visible from the outside -
                    MB-SR60N EFEKT. Owing to an extensive range of profiles and
                    accessories to choose from, the architects and designers can
                    implement even the most daring aluminium-glass facade
                    designs. For horizontally and vertically faceted walls
                    special overlay profiles are used, accompanied with
                    specially shaped pressure bars and face caps, which
                    eliminate the restrictions in spatial arrangement of the
                    building and the need to use special angular mullions.
                    Modern accessories and connectors enable increasing the
                    allowable load and thus the facade infill module can weigh
                    up to 1,100 kg.

                    The MB-SR50N EFEKT system is used for the construction of

                    Its supporting structure is based on a modern and tested and
                    proven mullion and transom aluminium system MB-SR50N, which
                    provides a wide range of profiles to choose from and the
                    possibility of selecting sections so that the surface of
                    mullions and transoms is flush with the internal side of
                    faÃ§ade, and thus its aesthetic joint with development
                    elements inside the building is ensured. It also ensures
                    compatibility with other constructions based on the wide
                    range of products offered by Aluprof SA. <br /><br />

                    MB-SR50N EFEKT is a faÃ§ade that provides a uniform external
                    appearance of a smooth glass wall divided by the structure
                    of vertical and horizontal lines of 2 cm, thanks to the use
                    of a special system for fixing panes to mullions and
                    transoms. The gaps between glass fields of the faÃ§ade are
                    filled with a special silicon binder to ensure high
                    tightness of the construction and enhance its insulation
                    properties. <br /><br />

                    One of the basic advantages of the MB-SR50N EFEKT faÃ§ade is
                    the rich capabilities of glazing: the wide range of infills
                    available in the catalogue includes one- or two-chamber
                    glass, as well as non-transparent panels based on complex
                    glass. The real novelty, and undoubtedly the hit of this
                    type of faÃ§ades, is the possibility of using glass units
                    with a laminated pane. The precisely developed infill
                    mounting system allows the flexible and economic adjustment
                    to the technical requirements of a specific project â it is
                    diverse depending on glass weight and includes solutions
                    that enable loads to be transferred from panes to profiles
                    in such a manner that a load capacity of up to 450 kg can be
                    obtained. We have two standard pane mounting variants at our
                    disposal: with the use of continuous or point frame, which
                    allows the manufacturing process and price to be optimised.
                    Another big advantage of the system is the fact that it has
                    recommendations from three world leading suppliers of
                    constructional and weather-resistant silicones: Dow Corning,
                    Sica and Tremco-Ilbruck, which not only enhance the prestige
                    of this solution, but also ensure and guarantee the
                    resistance and tightness of the construction, as well as
                    easy access to technologies for glazing companies. In this
                    system, the possibility of using silicon in different
                    colours is also worthy of attention, as it significantly
                    widens the spectrum for the creation of faÃ§ade aesthetics.
                    <br /><br />

                    FaÃ§ades made in the MB-SR50N EFEKT system have excellent
                    utility parameters. Their use allows not only the desired
                    faÃ§ade aesthetics to be obtained, but also very high thermal
                    insulating power, which is, due to a strong, worldwide trend
                    oriented at the limitation of the energy consumption of
                    buildings, one of the main criteria for assessment of
                    contemporary curtain walls. <br /><br />

                    The system is designed for the construction and execution of
                    flat, light-weight curtain walls of the suspended or filling
                    type, roofs, skylights and other structures.

                <div class="products__text">
                  The shape of mullions and transoms allows for erecting
                  aesthetic faÃ§ades with visible narrow division lines, ensuring
                  at the same time durability and strength of the structure.
                  Rounded profiles of the radius of 2.5 mm, characteristic of
                  the MB-SR50 system, have been replaced in the MB-SR50N system
                  by âsharp edgeâ. This change essentially influences the
                  aesthetic aspect of the structure. The applied shape of
                  profiles enables selection of mullion and transom profiles
                  which flush with each other on the inside surface of the
                  faÃ§ade. When the structure is glazed, visually it forms a
                  truss. It facilitates at the same time aesthetic and very
                  accurate connection with other elements of the development -
                  with internal walls and suspended ceilings. <br /><br />

                  Among characteristics of the MB-SR50N system is a wide choice
                  of mullion profiles (between 65 mm and 325 mm) and transom
                  profiles (between 5 mm and 189.5 mm) and modern solutions
                  designed for accessories and connecting members. Such features
                  allow for a wider range of loads which are being carried â an
                  infill in a fixed module of the faÃ§ade may weigh up to 1100
                  kg. The MB-SR50N system gives considerable freedom while
                  laying out faÃ§ade fixing points. A wide glazing range allows
                  for application of glazing of large dimensions and two-chamber
                  insulating glazing units. <br /><br />

                  Application of a continuous thermal barrier made of insulating
                  material called âHPVCâ and profiled (grooved) EPDM glazing
                  gaskets makes it possible to obtain proper thermal insulation
                  class and reduce to a minimum vapour condensation on aluminium
                  elements. <br /><br />

                  Among aesthetic varieties of the MB-SR50N system, likewise in
                  older mullion / transom curtain walls are the following
                  versions: PL (so-called âhorizontal and vertical lineâ where
                  an emphasis is placed on either horizontal or vertical
                  division) and a semi-structural faÃ§ade of the EFEKT type. A
                  particular attention should be drawn to the version featuring
                  enhanced thermal insulation performance, i.e. MB-SR50N HI, in
                  which special two-component insulators have been applied.
                  <br /><br />

                  The MB-SR50N system enables installation in the faÃ§ade of
                  various types of windows and doors, including windows designed
                  for the faÃ§ades incorporating an awning window and a roof
                  window. A particularly good visual effect is achieved when
                  faÃ§ade-integrated windows based on the MB-SR50 IW solution are
                  installed in this system. <br /><br />

                  Lintel and sill belts of the faÃ§ade, due to a sandwich-type
                  structure in which nonâflammable materials have been used,
                  such as mineral wool and plasterboards, may obtain, like in
                  the case of other Aluprof systems, fireproof classification
                  EI30 and EI60, depending on the structure. <br /><br />

                  In order to construct broken walls, both in their vertical and
                  horizontal sections, there have been used special overlapping
                  profiles and properly shaped clamping and concealing strips
                  with the effect that there are no limitations whatsoever as to
                  shaping the building body and the need to use special corner
                  mullions is eliminated. <br /><br />

                  Heavy-duty faÃ§ade consoles, adapted to the maximum weights of
                  the infills that can be used with this system. <br /><br />

                  As regards the declaration of conformity for vertical faÃ§ades
                  based on the MB-SR50N system, a harmonized European Standard
                  PN-EN 13830 âCurtain Walling. Product Standardâ has been
                  applied as a reference document. <br /><br />

                  Aluprof obtained positive results of hurricane tests conducted
                  for the MB-SR50N system in accordance with ASTM guidelines and
                  Florida Building Code TAS 201-94, TAS 202-94 and TAS 203-94.
