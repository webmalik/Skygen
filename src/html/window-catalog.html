                    MB-79N Casement is part of the MB-79N system used for
                    constructions such as: fixed, casement, tilt, tilt and turn
                    and tilt and slide windows, single and double-leaf external
                    doors, as well as shopfront solutions with doors. Its main
                    features are good thermal and acoustic insulation as well as
                    water and air tightness. The windows are adapted to the
                    stricter thermal insulation requirements of the European
                    Directive 2010/31/EU in force from 2021, allowing their use
                    in passive buildings.
                    <br /><br />
                    Depending on particular needs, there are two variants of
                    aluminium sections to choose from with different technical
                    parameters: the ST variant (with a two-component central
                    seal) and the SI variant (with an additional insulation
                    insert inside the chamber between the thermal breaks).
                    Thanks to the wide range of sections and their rigidity,
                    this system allows for making large and heavy structures. It
                    is also characterised by excellent kinematics, which allows
                    for the construction of very narrow windows. MB-79N Casement

                    It is also ideal for use in the renovation of industrial
                    buildings, where it allows the style of traditional steel
                    windows to be retained.
                    <br /><br />
                    The system's versatility is ensured by the availability of
                    three different profile aesthetic variants: Classic, Ferro
                    and Cubic. The possibility of virtually free mixing of
                    frames, sashes and girders between variants makes it easy to
                    tailor the ideal configuration.

                    The system is ideally suited to the production of windows,
                    doors and balcony doors.

                    Masterline 8 Functional offers three levels of insulation,
                    which makes it suitable for installation in buildings with
                    low energy needs, energy-efficient and even passive
                    buildings. Each individual will find something for
                    themselves. The system solution offers new options for
                    opening sashes of various dimensions, including one or
                    two-sash balcony doors with a low threshold.

                    Designers placed great emphasis on the maximum use of
                    daylight while maintaining the highest level of thermal
                    insulation.

              The Cortizo Casement system is designed entirely for

                    It is characterised by delicate, slender profiles that use
                    the highest quality aluminium. Attention is drawn to the
                    perfectly balanced glass-to-frame ratio, which allows more
                    natural light into the interior. Windows made using this
                    system are sturdy and meet strict British safety standards.
                    The thermal break used in the system means that the windows
                    have excellent thermal and acoustic performance in the
                    standard version. You can also choose the HI version for
                    increased insulation.

                    The colours are gloss lacquered as standard, but a matt
                    version is also available. The windows are available in a
                    flush profile with espagnolettes and scissor hinges. It is
                    possible to equip the windows with special fittings that
                    make daily use, cleaning and maintenance easier. This is the
                    so-called easy-clean feature. Different window sizes and
                    glazing units are available depending on the selected
                    sashes. Casement windows are mainly dedicated to the British
                    market, but they will certainly also find their enthusiasts
                    in Poland.
