					Lift and slide door system with high thermal properties. It enables the construction of large-format
					glazing while
					maintaining the best thermal insulation parameters.
				</div>
				<p>
					The system is available in three variants: Basic, Standard and Premium. Each of them has a different
					threshold. When
					using the Premium version, it can be freely used in low-energy buildings.
					<br><br>
					To maintain the aesthetics of the finish in the Premium version, we enable the installation of Aluskin
					aluminium covers.
					This solution has been reserved exclusively for this sliding door system.
					<br><br>
					The profiles can have a white, brown, cream or anthracite core. Thanks to this, when using veneers, you
					can obtain a
					consistent colour of the profile.
					<br><br>
					The HST 85 system enables the construction of large-sized, glazed lift and slide doors. The maximum width
					of the set is
					as much as 6.7 meters, and the maximum permissible dimensions of the wings are 3x2.5 m.
