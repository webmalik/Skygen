					The MB-86 Fold Line system has been designed for the production of large glazed surfaces in folding
					design.
				</div>
				<p>
					The main advantage of the system is almost complete removal of the barrier between the interior of the
					room and the open
					space. The doors can have any sash configuration and can be opened both to the outside and inside of the
					building. The
					leaves are slid along rails on which the whole mechanism is installed.
					<br><br>
					The system is available in two threshold variants. The first one is classic with rebate sealing, and the
					second with a
					low threshold, which is very convenient to use. Steel rollers ensure quick and easy door operation, and
					brushes in the
					driving corners provide protection against dirt entering the corner.
