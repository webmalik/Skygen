					Characterized by Italian design, the Cor Vision system was created to minimize the visibility of
					profiles, which may
					constitute only 9% of the structure.
				</div>
				<p>
					This is to increase the glazing and improve the aesthetic experience of this prestigious solution. The
					effect obtained
					has been further improved by enabling the embedding of lower, upper and side frames.
					<br><br>
					A characteristic feature of the Cor Vision system is that there is no need to use a corner post when
					connecting the
					sashes at an angle of 90 Â° In the case of the single-track system option, it is possible to hide the rail
					in the
					permanent glazing area. Reinforced frames ensure high durability and allow the use of sashes with a
					maximum weight of
					320 kg. The Uw coefficient reaches a satisfactory level of 1.3W / m?K.
