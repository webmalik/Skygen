					The perfect choice for customers looking for an economical solution for small spaces.
				</div>
				<p>
					Sliding structures made on the basis of this system will work well in places where balcony windows with
					an inward
					opening sash cannot be used, due to the limited space in the room.
					<br><br>
					With the Multi Slide system you can make sliding doors with a maximum area of 7.25 m?. The use of a
					special frame
					profile, which acts as an additional track, enables the construction of a three-track structure. Thanks
					to this, an
					effect similar to the folding door can be obtained, where the following sashes, after opening, slide over
					one of the
					extreme sections, creating one, uninterrupted passageway.
					<br><br>
					The Multi Slide system uses brush seals at the contact point of the sashes with the frame and between the
					sashes.
