					Smart Slide is a sliding door, but the innovative closing mechanism allows for simple and intuitive
					operation, similar
					to the solutions used in lift-slide doors.

				<p>
					It is worth recommending the system to your clients for another reason. Using it, you can easily make
					larger structures,
					in which the sash can reach a size of up to 1.5 x 2.3 m.
					<br><br>
					The installation depth is 140 mm, and the glazing units can have a maximum width of 42 mm. This means
					that the doors
					based on the Smart Slide system are not only functional, they can be used to create large structures, but
					also have high
					thermal values.
					<br><br>
					Smart Slide sliding doors can be equipped with air inlets. We also recommend a full range of smooth and
					wood-like
					veneers, thanks to which the doors will adapt to any type of interior or facade.
