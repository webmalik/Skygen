					Glazed lift and slide doors are a guarantee of optical enlargement of the interior and they fill it with
					natural light.
				</div>
				<p>
					Thanks to the appropriate construction of profiles, the doors made based on the MB-77 HS system also
					provide full
					thermal comfort and convenience of use. One of several door arrangements can be selected. Door frames are
					available in
					two variants - two-tack rail and three-track rail.
					<br><br>
					The system is characterised by a closed shape of glazing strips. Permanent panels can be provided, with
					panes mounted
					directly in the frame. MB-77 HS offers additional solutions that allow you to build even the most complex
					structures. In
					addition to fixed glazing within the frame, we can also mention a corner connection or a 3-track rail
					frame. MB-77HS
					sliding doors move according to one of seven patterns.
