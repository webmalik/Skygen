					MasterPatio is a technologically advanced response to the need to obtain the largest possible glazing in
					sliding and
					tilt door systems.
				</div>
				<p>
					The profiles are almost invisible in it and constitute only about 10% of the opening's lumen. The
					visibility of plastic
					elements and gaskets that are hidden in the profiles has been minimized. At the same time, it was
					possible to obtain a
					thermal transmittance coefficient suitable for passive buildings (up to 0.9W / (m?K)).
					<br><br>
					The MasterPatio system can even cover the entire wall. It is possible to create almost the entire facade
					with its use.
					The maximum height of the element is 3.5 m, and the weight of the sliding and titing sash can reach 500
					kg. Glazed doors
					are packages up to 62mm wide. The solution is fully compatible with the Masterline 8 window and door
					system, which
					dramatically enriches the design possibilities. In some variants, a low threshold or a threshold flush
					with the floor
					can be used.
