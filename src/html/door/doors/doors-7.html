				<p>
					INFINITI sectional doors offer a lot of opportunities, especially when it comes to additional lighting of
					the garage or
					workshop. The door sections can be fitted with a very large glazing made of transparent or privacy glass
					without
					blocking most of the natural light. Doors with glazed sections are available in the same sizes as the
					other options. The
					width of the panoramic glazing can reach up to 3 meters without the use of additional mullions.
					Possibility of using a
					ventilation section (expanded mesh filling).
