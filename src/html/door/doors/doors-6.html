					The door leaf is made of panels with heights: 500, 555 and 610 mm. Depending on the height of the door,
					different panel
					heights are used. The manufacturer decides about the height of the panels used. 40 mm thick panels are
					made of
					galvanized steel sheet and additionally filled with CFC-free polyurethane foam. The panels are veneered
					or covered with
					polyester paints. A gasket adhering to the base is installed in the bottom panel. A seal mounted to the
					top panel or
					attached to the lintel provides a seal between the top panel and the lintel.
