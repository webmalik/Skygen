					The backyard terrace is a place where social and family life
					is vibrant. The pergolas we produce offer several square feet
					of additional space for spending free time outside, regardless
					of the weather conditions. Durable aluminum construction
					and proven components will allow you to enjoy your home
					terrace for many years. <br><br>
					The Pergola is an extension of the living room to the garden part. The structure
					consists of a stable aluminum frame and an opening roof, thanks to which
					the amount of light on the terrace can be adjusted. Innovative solution as rain,
					wind and temperature sensor give you extra opportunities to access the space regardless of weather
					conditions, while not
					requiring any moves.
