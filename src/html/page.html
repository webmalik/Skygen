						Safe windows are equipped with appropriate profiles. To be able to
						give them anti-burglary status, they must have a closed steel
						reinforcement throughout their perimeter and be permanently screwed
						to the profiles with screws. If windows and balcony doors are to
						constitute a solid barrier for burglars, it is worth supplementing
						the fittings with additional elements. Examples include
						anti-burglary catches, anti-burglary pivots with adjustable pressure
						or a lock for incorrect handle position. The construction of
						profiles, fittings, glass, and handles are the basic elements that
						affect the safety of the window joinery. If we want even better
						protection of real estate, property, and household members, let’s
						opt for an alarm system and special anti-burglary roller blinds.
