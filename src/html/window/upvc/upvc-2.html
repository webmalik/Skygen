					A system dedicated to the production of outward opening windows, popular in particular in Great Britain,
					Australia and
					the USA.
				</div>
				<p>
					Recommended both for installation in residential and public utility buildings. Their classic appearance
					makes them
					appreciated by customers.
					The system offers great design opportunites.
					<br><br>
					Windows based on the Ideal 4000 Casement system look identical on the outside and inside - both the slats
					and profiles
					have a simple shape. The glazing bead securing system meets the requirements of the Secure by Design and
					PAS24 programs.
					<br><br>
					Thanks to a wide number of additional profiles, connectors and extensions, you can create windows of
					various
					combinations. Windows made on the basis of the Ideal 4000 Casement system are also characterized by very
					good thermal
					properties that allow to obtain Uw values below 0.9W / m?K.
