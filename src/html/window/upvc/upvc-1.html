					It is a universal system that works perfectly in both modern architecture of single-family and multi
					family housing, as
					well as while renovating.
				</div>
				<p>
					As standard, windows made on the basis of the Ideal 4000 system are equipped with two anti-burglary
					catches on the sash
					and pivots to prevent burglary with adjustable pressure. An important element of the fitting is the
					central clamp. The
					clamp automatically adjusts to the clearance. It ensures not only safety, but also tightness and light
					functioning of
					window sashes. As standard, all fittings for tilt-and-turn windows are supplemented with a lock against
					handle
					misplacement. An additional functional element is the micro-ventilation scissor, which creates the
					possibility of slot
					ventilation.
