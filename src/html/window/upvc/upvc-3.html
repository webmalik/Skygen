					The optimal combination of innovative technology and the best thermal
					protection parameters, appropriate for energy-saving construction.
				</div>
				<p>
					Windows made in the BluEvolution 82 system are already equipped as standard with a two-chamber package of
					warm glass
					with a heat transfer coefficient of Ug = 0.5W / m?K.
					<br><br>
					A huge advantage is the profiles themselves, which are not only made of high-quality PVC, but above all
					are an excellent
					thermal insulator, which is guaranteed by the six-chamber structure of the profile and the triple sealing
					system. The
					installation depth of 82 mm allows for glazing
					with packets up to a width of 53 mm. If the window is also supplemented with a warm spacer, we can obtain
					thermal
					transmittance parameters corresponding to those of energy-saving windows, additionally reducing the risk
					of temporary
					condensation of water vapor.
					<br><br>
					The profiles are made of the highest quality PVC, thanks to which they are characterized by a unique,
					shiny, snow-white
					color.
