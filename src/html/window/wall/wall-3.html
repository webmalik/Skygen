					SEMISTRUCTURAL MULLION/TRANSOM curtain walls
				</div>
				<p>
					The MB-SR50N EFEKT system is used for the construction of
					lightweight curtain walls of a hanging and filling type as
					well as roofs, skylights and other spatial constructions.

					Its supporting structure is based on a modern and tested and
					proven mullion and transom aluminium system MB-SR50N, which
					provides a wide range of profiles to choose from and the
					possibility of selecting sections so that the surface of
					mullions and transoms is flush with the internal side of
					façade, and thus its aesthetic joint with development
					elements inside the building is ensured. It also ensures
					compatibility with other constructions based on the wide
					range of products offered by Aluprof SA. <br /><br />

					MB-SR50N EFEKT is a façade that provides a uniform external
					appearance of a smooth glass wall divided by the structure
					of vertical and horizontal lines of 2 cm, thanks to the use
					of a special system for fixing panes to mullions and
					transoms. The gaps between glass fields of the façade are
					filled with a special silicon binder to ensure high
					tightness of the construction and enhance its insulation
					properties. <br /><br />

					One of the basic advantages of the MB-SR50N EFEKT façade is
					the rich capabilities of glazing: the wide range of infills
					available in the catalogue includes one- or two-chamber
					glass, as well as non-transparent panels based on complex
					glass. The real novelty, and undoubtedly the hit of this
					type of façades, is the possibility of using glass units
					with a laminated pane. The precisely developed infill
					mounting system allows the flexible and economic adjustment
					to the technical requirements of a specific project – it is
					diverse depending on glass weight and includes solutions
					that enable loads to be transferred from panes to profiles
					in such a manner that a load capacity of up to 450 kg can be
					obtained. We have two standard pane mounting variants at our
					disposal: with the use of continuous or point frame, which
					allows the manufacturing process and price to be optimised.
					Another big advantage of the system is the fact that it has
					recommendations from three world leading suppliers of
					constructional and weather-resistant silicones: Dow Corning,
					Sica and Tremco-Ilbruck, which not only enhance the prestige
					of this solution, but also ensure and guarantee the
					resistance and tightness of the construction, as well as
					easy access to technologies for glazing companies. In this
					system, the possibility of using silicon in different
					colours is also worthy of attention, as it significantly
					widens the spectrum for the creation of façade aesthetics.
					<br /><br />

					Façades made in the MB-SR50N EFEKT system have excellent
					utility parameters. Their use allows not only the desired
					façade aesthetics to be obtained, but also very high thermal
					insulating power, which is, due to a strong, worldwide trend
					oriented at the limitation of the energy consumption of
					buildings, one of the main criteria for assessment of
					contemporary curtain walls. <br /><br />
