					MULLION-TRANSOM CURTAIN WALL
				</div>
				<p>
					The system is designed for the construction and execution of
					flat, light-weight curtain walls of the suspended or filling
					type, roofs, skylights and other structures.

				The shape of mullions and transoms allows for erecting
				aesthetic façades with visible narrow division lines, ensuring
				at the same time durability and strength of the structure.
				Rounded profiles of the radius of 2.5 mm, characteristic of
				the MB-SR50 system, have been replaced in the MB-SR50N system
				by “sharp edge”. This change essentially influences the
				aesthetic aspect of the structure. The applied shape of
				profiles enables selection of mullion and transom profiles
				which flush with each other on the inside surface of the
				façade. When the structure is glazed, visually it forms a
				truss. It facilitates at the same time aesthetic and very
				accurate connection with other elements of the development -
				with internal walls and suspended ceilings. <br /><br />

				Among characteristics of the MB-SR50N system is a wide choice
				of mullion profiles (between 65 mm and 325 mm) and transom
				profiles (between 5 mm and 189.5 mm) and modern solutions
				designed for accessories and connecting members. Such features
				allow for a wider range of loads which are being carried – an
				infill in a fixed module of the façade may weigh up to 1100
				kg. The MB-SR50N system gives considerable freedom while
				laying out façade fixing points. A wide glazing range allows
				for application of glazing of large dimensions and two-chamber
				insulating glazing units. <br /><br />

				Application of a continuous thermal barrier made of insulating
				material called ”HPVC” and profiled (grooved) EPDM glazing
				gaskets makes it possible to obtain proper thermal insulation
				class and reduce to a minimum vapour condensation on aluminium
				elements. <br /><br />

				Among aesthetic varieties of the MB-SR50N system, likewise in
				older mullion / transom curtain walls are the following
				versions: PL (so-called “horizontal and vertical line” where
				an emphasis is placed on either horizontal or vertical
				division) and a semi-structural façade of the EFEKT type. A
				particular attention should be drawn to the version featuring
				enhanced thermal insulation performance, i.e. MB-SR50N HI, in
				which special two-component insulators have been applied.
				<br /><br />

				The MB-SR50N system enables installation in the façade of
				various types of windows and doors, including windows designed
				for the façades incorporating an awning window and a roof
				window. A particularly good visual effect is achieved when
				façade-integrated windows based on the MB-SR50 IW solution are
				installed in this system. <br /><br />

				Lintel and sill belts of the façade, due to a sandwich-type
				structure in which non–flammable materials have been used,
				such as mineral wool and plasterboards, may obtain, like in
				the case of other Aluprof systems, fireproof classification
				EI30 and EI60, depending on the structure. <br /><br />

				In order to construct broken walls, both in their vertical and
				horizontal sections, there have been used special overlapping
				profiles and properly shaped clamping and concealing strips
				with the effect that there are no limitations whatsoever as to
				shaping the building body and the need to use special corner
				mullions is eliminated. <br /><br />

				Heavy-duty façade consoles, adapted to the maximum weights of
				the infills that can be used with this system. <br /><br />

				As regards the declaration of conformity for vertical façades
				based on the MB-SR50N system, a harmonized European Standard
				PN-EN 13830 “Curtain Walling. Product Standard” has been
				applied as a reference document. <br /><br />

				Aluprof obtained positive results of hurricane tests conducted
				for the MB-SR50N system in accordance with ASTM guidelines and
				Florida Building Code TAS 201-94, TAS 202-94 and TAS 203-94.
