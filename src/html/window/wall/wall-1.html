					MULLION AND TRANSOM CURTAIN WALL WITH HIGH THERMAL
					PERFORMANCE
				</div>
				<p>
					The structure presented here is a version of MB-SR50N
					featuring enhanced thermal insulation performance.
					<br /><br />
					The system is designed for the construction and execution of
					flat, light-weight curtain walls of the suspended or filling
					type, roofs, skylights and other structures. The shapes of
					profiles enable selection of mullion and transom profiles
					which flush with each other on the inside surface of the
					façade.

					The MB-SR50N HI system features basic characteristics and
					possibilities inherent in the base construction MB-SR50N.
					The thermal insulation zone deserves a particular mention,
					though. Here, special two-component insulators have been
					applied. They are based on a HPVC insulator (or a set of
					insulators of appropriate width), which makes it possible to
					drive screws with high accuracy during the installation
					process at the building site. On both lateral surfaces of
					the insulator additional elements made of flexible material
					are attached (glued on), which enhance thermal insulation
					performance and limit the air flow in the space separating
					the infills of the façade. The insulator built in this way
					enables maintaining convenience and accuracy of mounting of
					a traditional façade, ensuring at the same time that very
					good thermal insulation parameters are attained – the heat
					transfer coefficient, depending on the applied profiles and
					accessories spans between 0,94 to ,.94 W/m2K. Likewise in
					the base version of the façade, the structure allows for
					installation of different types of infills, including
					glazing of large dimensions and two-chamber insulating
					glazing units. With regard to active elements, the MB-70HI
					doors and windows featuring enhanced thermal insulation
					performance are particularly recommended for façades of the
					HI series.
