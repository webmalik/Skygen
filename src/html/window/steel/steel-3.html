		The selection of a glazing package is often limited to the selection of the number of panes, which makes them more
		or
		less energy-efficient. However, our offer is much wider. We offer energy-saving, sound-absorbing, safe,
		anti-burglary
		and anti-sun glass panes. Additionally, we have a wide range of ornamental glass in dozens of designs to choose
		from.
		<br><br>
		The inter-pane space of the formed glazing units is usually filled with 90% argon. We also offer krypton-filled
		glass,
		thanks to which it is possible to obtain a heat transfer coefficient of up to 0.3 W/mÂ²K.
		<br><br>
		The possibility of combining different types of glass and a smaller or larger number of panes allows for obtaining
		the
		appropriate parameters for each type of windows and doors from our offer.
