		The return to industrial design means that steel joinery still arouses great interest. It is not only a unique
		decoration for architecture, but also safety and high thermal and acoustic parameters
		<br><br>
		Steel joinery mostly used for historic buildings and tenement houses in order to maintain the original shape and
		appearance. Steel allows you to create visually subtle constructions, which are impossible to make from aluminium
		profiles.
		<br><br>
		Steel elements are also used in industrial facilities due to their excellent strength and long lasting effect. Due
		to
		high impact resistance, vandalresistant doors can be used in public utility places and in places particularly
		exposed to
		devastation.
		<br><br>
		We offer two steel systems: with a thermal break or - in buildings with lower energy needs - without a thermal
		break.
		Both systems are ideal for the construction of windows, doors, partition walls, vestibules, display cases,
		showcases and
		all types of spatial structures.
