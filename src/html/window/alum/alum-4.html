					Masterline 8 Functional offers three levels of insulation,
					which makes it suitable for installation in buildings with
					low energy needs, energy-efficient and even passive
					buildings. Each individual will find something for
					themselves. The system solution offers new options for
					opening sashes of various dimensions, including one or
					two-sash balcony doors with a low threshold.
