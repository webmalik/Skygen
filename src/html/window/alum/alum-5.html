					The Cortizo Casement system is designed entirely for
					outward-opening windows
				</div>
				<p>
					It is characterised by delicate, slender profiles that use
					the highest quality aluminium. Attention is drawn to the
					perfectly balanced glass-to-frame ratio, which allows more
					natural light into the interior. Windows made using this
					system are sturdy and meet strict British safety standards.
					The thermal break used in the system means that the windows
					have excellent thermal and acoustic performance in the
					standard version. You can also choose the HI version for
					increased insulation.

			<div class="products__text">
				<div class="products__subtitle">
					The system has a wide range of finishing options with RAL
					colours
				</div>
				<p>
					The colours are gloss lacquered as standard, but a matt
					version is also available. The windows are available in a
					flush profile with espagnolettes and scissor hinges. It is
					possible to equip the windows with special fittings that
					make daily use, cleaning and maintenance easier. This is the
					so-called easy-clean feature. Different window sizes and
					glazing units are available depending on the selected
					sashes. Casement windows are mainly dedicated to the British
					market, but they will certainly also find their enthusiasts
					in Poland.
