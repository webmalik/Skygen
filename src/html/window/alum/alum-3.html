					The Reynaers SlimLine 38 system is designed for modern
					architecture requiring large glazing
				</div>
				<p>
					It is also ideal for use in the renovation of industrial
					buildings, where it allows the style of traditional steel
					windows to be retained.
					<br /><br />
					The system's versatility is ensured by the availability of
					three different profile aesthetic variants: Classic, Ferro
					and Cubic. The possibility of virtually free mixing of
					frames, sashes and girders between variants makes it easy to
					tailor the ideal configuration.
