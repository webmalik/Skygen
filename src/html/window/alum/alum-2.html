					A modern and economical window system with improved thermal
					insulation parameters
				</div>
				<p>
					MB-79N Casement is part of the MB-79N system used for
					constructions such as: fixed, casement, tilt, tilt and turn
					and tilt and slide windows, single and double-leaf external
					doors, as well as shopfront solutions with doors. Its main
					features are good thermal and acoustic insulation as well as
					water and air tightness. The windows are adapted to the
					stricter thermal insulation requirements of the European
					Directive 2010/31/EU in force from 2021, allowing their use
					in passive buildings.
					<br /><br />
					Depending on particular needs, there are two variants of
					aluminium sections to choose from with different technical
					parameters: the ST variant (with a two-component central
					seal) and the SI variant (with an additional insulation
					insert inside the chamber between the thermal breaks).
					Thanks to the wide range of sections and their rigidity,
					this system allows for making large and heavy structures. It
					is also characterised by excellent kinematics, which allows
					for the construction of very narrow windows. MB-79N Casement
					window profile alternatives: Top Hung and Side Hung
