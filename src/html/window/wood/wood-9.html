					In addition to the standard frame
					made of aluminium, we also offer
					one of the best warm spacers
					available in the world.
					<br><br>
					With the Swisspacer Ultimate
					spacer, the is factor is only
					0.03 W / mÂ²K. The lower value
					of this coefficient not only reduces
					the possibility of water vapour
					condensation on the edges
					of the glass, but also allows for
					a significant reduction of the
					thermal transmittance coefficient
					for the entire window.
					<br><br>
					The frames are available
					in several colours from
					the RAL palette.

					RC1 and RC2 are burglary resistance classes that have been defined
					in the European standard PN-EN 1627: 2012. The markings tell you
					how effective the window technique is for a burglar. It is determined
					based on very strict criteria. RC2 windows should be installed where
					there is a risk of burglary. They will work well on high and low ground
					floors - places to which a thief can get a very easy access to, as well as at
					balcony and terrace doors. RC1 windows, in turn, have standard security.
