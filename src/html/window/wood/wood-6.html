				<p>
					Wood is a natural noble material that is obtained from trees intended for planned felling. This minimizes
					the negative
					impact on the environment, as new trees are planted in the place of the felled trees. It is a completely
					natural and
					ecological product, pleasant to the touch. It is characterized primarily by excellent acoustic and
					thermal insulation
					parameters, as well as high resistance to external factors.
					<br><br>
					The high quality of wooden windows and doors is determined by properly selected and dried wood and its
					density. Our
					product line includes products made of spruce, pine, oak and meranti.
