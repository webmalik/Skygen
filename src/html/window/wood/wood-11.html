          Wooden windows are an option for those who appreciate the beauty and
          natural character of wood. They will satisfy those who like to enjoy
          bright and spacious interiors. Wooden windows add character to any
          room and make it cosier. The natural appearance of wood pleases the
          eye and "warms" the interior
          <br /><br />
          The windows are available in the depths of the frame construction -
          65, 68, 74, 75, 76, 80, 86, 88 and 92 mm. They are made of four types
          of wood - pine, spruce, meranti or oak. Wooden windows are also
          available with an aluminium cover, which provides additional
          protection against external factors and provides unlimited arrangement
          possibilities
