					The selection of a glazing package is often limited to the selection of the number of panes, which makes
					them more
					or less energy-efficient. However, our offer is much wider. We offer energy-saving, sound-absorbing,
					safe, anti-burglary
					and anti-sun glass panes. In addition, we have a wide range of ornamental glass in several dozen designs
					to choose from.
					<br><br>
					The inter-pane space of the formed units is usually filled with 90% argon. We also offer krypton-filled
					glass,
					thanks to which it is possible to obtain a heat transfer coefficient of up to 0.3 W / mÂ²K.
					<br><br>
					The possibility of combining different types of glass and a smaller or more glass panes allows
					to obtain the appropriate parameters for each type of windows and doors from our offer.
